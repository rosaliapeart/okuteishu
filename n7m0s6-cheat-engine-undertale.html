I downloaded CheatEngine for Mac last week because I wanted to mess around with games like Undertale. I have 'removed' it from my computer but ever since I downloaded it some weird things have been occurring: \-'Chromium' would launch whenever I'd turn on my laptop (never downloaded chromium) \- 'Chrome' was using YAHOO as its default search engine when I never changed it from google \-Now a weird 'tymxl-fn2302md' computer is appearing under 'SHARED' in Finder (which has never been there.

Do we still care about spoilers? Consider this whole post a spoiler. If you keep reading past this point - you're going to have a bad time. I'm not condoning or teaching any cheats, and this is more of a narrative driven question than a mechanical one. Though I suppose for this game those are interchangeable. So. When you fight Sans, I had this idea. Reading into his dialogue and photoshop flowey's, they mention the idea of control from beyond the game and it all gets a bit meta. Photoshop.

#### 19th October - 25th October Trying out a new, potentially weekly thing here that was requested by MANY users! Basically, a summary of all the events and notable submissions of the past 7 days. Hope you guys enjoy. Edit: Just to clarify, the posts mentioned in these threads do not all receive Reddit Gold, it is just a showcase of the "Gold" content of the week! ## MOD POSTS PSA: Please stop killing the community (https://redd.it/3pitqv) - On the 20th of October • Main steam account for sale, used for 3.6 years. • Steam level: 14 For all the time, not a single ban (VAC) has been received, no cheats or other third-party software has ever been used. Through it passed a lot of expensive and inexpensive skins. Now in the inventory there is nothing special  All of the Steam Games included • Counter-Strike: Global Offensive • Rocket League • Grand Theft Auto Five • Battlerite Founders Editions (contains all champions, titles, and more). • Streets. To be brief, I've started hunting for Gaster. The importance of the ability to "SAVE" is referenced a lot in the game's story. Even CHARA, the original fallen child (at the end of the genocide run) remarks that it's the player's SOUL that holds the power, and CHARA wants it. Enough to try and bargain for it and steal it. Considering the importance of the "Fun" value in locating the "Grey NPCs" that tell you about Dr. W.D. Gaster, it isn't much of a leap to consider that editing 
Hey all, I found myself unable to beat genocide mode and since I play on a Mac I couldn't really use Cheat Engine. For a while I tried seeing if I could hack my HP by editing the save files but failed (you can do it to a degree, but I was only able to increase my HP to just a bit over my regular max, and then it would drop back below my max from that point on.) However, I did find out how to manipulate my inventory, no external programs needed. Here's how I did it, hopefully you'll Now, I'm pretty sure no one has posted about this. The search bar brings up nothing about it. But I've been playing with cheat engine and Undertale the past few days. I honestly fail pretty hard at bullet hell games, as a rule, so. the first thing I obviously decided to do is start looking for the memory value for the health. Nyeh heh heh, you can't hurt me, etc. With some help from /u/AntyIamon (https://www.reddit.com/user/AntyIamon), I've figured out where these numbers are coming from. This is a list of every room ID in Undertale! Use this for any Room ID needs you may have! Thanks! (Please note- All room IDs above 265 are unreachable without the use of Cheat Engine, which I cannot use. However, I hope this can still be a valulable resource for the Undertale community!) Here it is! (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bGnZjiSKjAjiHAwYxz09PJ1HVSCK3haCuPcjie0sfgk/edit?usp=sharing) EDIT: This sheet is not going to be updated until a way for me to use Cheat Engine/ 
I hadn't planned on playing Undertale until some of my friends recommended it to me and I gave it another look. I like story games, but I'm hesitant to play games with multiple endings because I like seeing all the content in a game and don't want to spend time re-playing, but I heard it had a good story and decided it was worth it. My original goal was to see all the endings and post-reset character text, which turned into a quest to see every string available in the game (similar but unrelated. I'm trying to use the Cheat Engine to force a battle in undertale, is there any other way I can do it and if not then how do you set it up so you can force a fight with Cheat Engine. I want to make a parody video of Undertale, but in order to make it as authentic as possible, I want to record footage from the game so I can get the sound effects. The only problem with this is that I can't find a way to turn off the music, which means any sound effects I record would be ruined by the music. Does anyone know how to turn off the music? Cheat Engine, maybe. WARNING : Do not watch or read this if you did not beat the game at least with the true and neutral endings. You can be spoiled of some content. -------------------------- I forget to put Spoiler on the title. ------------------------- So, some of you guys knows that a guy called RazorSharpFang start a stream called Twitch Plays UNDERTALE. We cannot always see the chat in his stream because he don't show the chat on-video H! I've been doing a lot of Undertale hacking/testing/stuff for a while (you may have seen some of my ridiculous gifs over on /r/Undertale). After being lazy forever, I'm finally going to be uploading my stuff to a public repo for people to do things with. At the moment it only has my updated cheat engine table (with a lot of stuff in it) and a patch for Underpatcher (https://www.reddit.com/r/Underminers/comments/3x8hc8/underpatcher/) which'll enable debug mode, but there's okay i decided to play undertale using cheat engine and set frisks attack and defence to 999. when i faught mettaton wth 999 defence i was able to do 25 damage when in most other case it misses. it means if frisks atk=enemy defence damage dealt=25. so with that we can say thay if frisks attack.
