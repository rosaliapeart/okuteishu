Hey everyone! I'll be going to my first show on the 4th at Atlantic Station. I got some absolutely amazing tickets and I'm pretty excited, but I'm still kinda confused on the norms of these kind of things. 1) If the show begins at 8, then what time should I be at the venue? Does this vary based off of where I am sitting? 2) Is there an "informal dress code?" 3) What should I be expecting? 4) If you have any tips that increase comfort/enjoyment feel free to share.

Hi, welcome to my post. I know it's not much, but it's mine, all mine. I have no idea how to write one of these, but I imagine talking about myself is probably a good idea. I'm a computer science student from Yorkshire, currently in Leicester for university. I'd like to think I'm fairly mature, but also very nerdy and I can be childish at times. At the weekend I went to London with my family to see Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna, but I was more excited for the new half-season of Star Wars: Rebels. 
This weekend away was booked as a birthday present for my girlfriend but unfortunately she has fallen ill. We were hoping she would recover enough to travel to London but unfortunately it's not looking like she will in time. We have: - 2 train tickets from Bath Spa to London Paddington leaving Sunday Morning and returning Monday evening. - 2 tickets to Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna at the Royal Albert Hall for Sunday evening - Hotel for Sunday night The train tickets are standard adult tickets.

We have: - 2 train tickets from Bath Spa to London Paddington leaving Sunday Morning and returning Monday evening. - 2 tickets to Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna at the Royal Albert Hall for Sunday evening - Hotel for Sunday night The train tickets. I hope this is allowed! I'm looking for a good ol' fashioned trade. I really, really, really want to go to Cirque du Soleil's Amaluna but I simply cannot afford it! I'm a student who spent the first half of her summer in NYC which is terribly expensive and, unfortunately, no one wants to hire me for the month before I go back to school. I'm hoping to trade some of my services for a ticket to the show; prices range from  on certain websites to 0. I sing classically We're from Louisiana, and the family and I have tickets for the Sunday matineé on February 22. We bought via Cirque Club and have extra amazing seats in the 4th row of Section 102! Anyways, we are looking for 1) Redditors who like Cirque du Soleil and 2) Ideas for family activities beyond what we've already done, i.e. we've been to the Zoo a bunch and to the Museum of Natural History and the Children's Museum.
