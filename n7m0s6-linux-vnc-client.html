VNC is a client-server GUI-based tool that allows you to connect via remote-desktop to your Clear Linux OS host. This guide shows I'm looking to remote into a Windows 7 Home Premium desktop (not server) from my Solus notebook. Any recommendations?

So I would like to access my VM's VNC Server on my public IP with a VNC Client and I port forwarded the VNC Server ports on my modem, router and on the VM itself but it still doesnt let me connect to it through my public IP.

I didnt do any changes in Proxmox itself, do I have to do something in Proxmox to open the ports? Or anybody has an idea why its not working?. 
Instructions and examples for using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) remote desktop functionality on Linux. I have a workstation that I host a few VMs on and occasionally I need to remote into them from my intranet because I can't be bothered to get off the couch and walk upstairs, is there a preferred method of doing this? Should I remote in to my server and open the VMs from virt manager there, or is it better to give each VM it's own VNC address? This access is over 5Ghz wifi, if I need to do any heavy lifting I walk my butt upstairs and access the VMs directly from my workstation. Just curious. Enable remote connections between computers by downloading VNC®. We have several linux applications that we need to make available to people who primarily use windows and macs.

Modern RDP Servers/Gateway lt--gt ??? Mystery Gateway ??? lt--gt Baked in hardware old VNC/RDP client. How to remotely display and control a Linux desktop from a Windows or Linux system using VNC  you can now launch the VNC viewer client.

Does anyone have any suggestions for Linux based alternative to Windows Remote Desktop Services? I know xrdp allows fairly easily to set up basic server for single user, but setting up persistent sessions for multiple users is not very convenient as you need to know your session number to reconnect to, or you'll end up creating tons of idle sessions. I'd like to not have to rely on 3rd party applications to establish the connection \(such as teamviewer\), and instead use Windows' built\-in.
