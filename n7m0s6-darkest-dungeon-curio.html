                            <p>In Darkest Dungeon: The Crimson Court, one of the first quests you’ll tackle in the Courtyard deals with the Thronging Hive Curio. This is a special Curio that requires you to utilize three Pitch Soaked Torches (different from your regular Torch), which you receive at the beginning of the quest.  ====SACRIFICIAL STONE - BAD CURIO No item can nullify the effect of this curio. Unless you are confident in your ability to get rid of -50 stress or gamble a 12.5% chance to gain a negative quirk instead, it would be recommended not to even use these curio whatsoever. Hello again. Someone else can take over from here if they want, it took way too much effort to do this. XD Data interpreted from: \DarkestDungeon\curios\curio_type_library.csv Notes: Best Draw/Worst Draw is relative to that specific Curio. "Treasure" type is sometimes specific to the Curio (Heirlooms only, Food only, etc.), however i did not know what the types are, so i just left it there. Now in spreadsheet form thanks to /u/panisch420! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18_bLmVS. 
Donation Points system. This mod is not opted-in to receive Donation Points. I'm looking for a game where there are a lot of encounters where you have multiple options, and depending on what you choose the result changes. Something in the same fashion as darkest dungeon curio interactions, slay the spire encounters. Basically a graphical rpg text adventure with some kind of game play on top of the interactions. Darkest Dungeon is one of the hardest, most infuriating and yet most fantastic games I've ever played. For me, its deference to challenge and perseverance in order to achieve success is unmatched. I'm kind of late to the party, since I've only recently started playing Darkest Dungeon. After one too many acquired negative quirk, I started using the wiki (https://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Curio) for searching the curios. To have a quicker reference, I've created a cheatsheet / diagram / map thingy for the curios and figured some of you guys may find it useful too: You can view / edit and export it online in yEd Live: Darkest Dungeon Curios Cheatsheet (https://www.yworks.com/yed-live/. Darkest Dungeon Non-Combat Tips and Tricks. Hamlet, Heirloom use, and more! - Duration: 23:34. ImAKitteh Gaming 23,306 views. Hey guys, currently studying to be a programmer and I tried my hand at making an interactive Darkest Dungeon curio guide here: https://darkestsidekick.github.io/ I love this game but it is kinda unique in that you are attached at the hip to the curio wiki page due to the brutal nature of the game. (You don't want to mess up a curio-provision interaction.) I've spent a lot of time scrolling up and down that wiki page or through similar cheatsheets. I wanted to create something that could conve. 
Welcome to the Darkest Sidekick. An interactive Darkest Dungeon curio guide. Jump to your location by clicking the region name. View recommended provisions by clicking on the dungeon length. I put all Curios and what items are required for a positive interaction so you can find it quickly: Darkest Dungeon Curio Cheat Sheet ( The interactions are datamined from the game CSVs so there's some additional interactions there that are currently missing from the wiki. I'll also be streaming some Darkest Dungeon and talking about game design evenings PST this week if you feel like dropping by! www.twitch.tv/swedetalksdesign. Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike turn-based RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring. Recruit, train, and lead a team of flawed heroes against unimaginable horrors, stress, famine, disease, and the ever-encroaching. UPDATE: New Curios list is available. WARNING: Contains spoilers, do not click if you want to find these out yourselves. Having said that, here is the new list. (   Alchemy Table: Herbs/Torch Animal Corpse: Herbs Bookpile: Torch(INCREASES STRESS) Cask/Kegs: Herbs Cabinet: Key/Shovel Chest: Key(MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T SAY UNLOCKED CHEST BEFORE USING) Confessional Booth: Holy Water. The team at Red Hook is thrilled to continue to support Darkest Dungeon with this latest DLC. We’re committed to providing our new and veteran players alike with the very best in all-consuming misery and morbidity. The Color of Madness DLC is planned for a spring release, and pricing information will follow in the new year. Console Updates. I'm so happy, this handy list ( has finally given me a visible path to beating this game. However, I can't help but feel as if I somehow put in a cheat code, I have never left a dungeon without profit. Sometimes I abandon dungeons with fifteen thousand in pocket and about thirty to forty total tokens. That being said, please don't remove the feeling of knowing how Curios work, I think Una pequeña guía sobre qué puede darte cada curio en el juego en función de con qué objeto la abras y una opinión personal sobre qué provisiones comprar segú. Greetings all, A few days back there was an excellent post ( by /u/TheHasegawaEffect detailing all the various interactions that can occur when touching clickable objects or using items on them. Then /u/panisch420 took it one step further and constructed a spreadsheet for it. My friend Vendetta and I are covering Darkest Dungeon on our channel, and thought it would be helpful to create The only way to “venture forth” is to ignore the curio. But last time i got the same issue again on the next curio … Don’t know this is a bug or intended: In the Hamlet the daily Message often seem to get stuck on “The Town is abbuz”, i get it at least 3/4 of the time…. 
The obvious combination is the Key with Locked Chests or Glass Cases. However, when searching 'things' in the various dungeons - you can apply most usable items to the treasure/searchable items. This usually ends with the item destroyed, with no effect - except the key and lock example. Has anyone else found other combinations that end with bonus rewards? Or Does anyone know if this feature is planed but not yet implemented? EDIT: /u/fixpont has pointed out this (http://www.reddit.com/r. First , I'm at week 80 and havent started the darkest dungeon yet. I have 3 boss locations at max level and still need to clear it. Right now I'm working on the alluring siren. My question is, how many weeks did you guys have before heading into the darkest dungeon. I'm terrible at this game and lost my best crew to the Hag nd then to the prophet so I'm levelling up some guys again. I also had 3 max level antiquarian and jesters and and lost them because I got too confident :( so yeah I'm prett. Hello Community! I have a question, or more, I'm looking for opinions. I have played bloodborne and dark souls 3 and 2 (yes in that order). I recently purchased darkest dungeon at a discounted price. I heard it was a difficult game and wanted a good challenge. With bloodborne and the souls games I took an approach not looking for any advice going in "cold turkey", if you will. I enjoy this approach because it leaves the game shrouded in mystery and makes for a little more challenging. Just picked up the game, approx 10 or so weeks in to my first save. Just beat the Hag after losing 3 people to her (in retrospect dim light for hell hairpin was not worth, nor was using leper) and I was wondering how to "progress". Ive upgraded blacksmith, guild and cart. How do you decide if a character is worht investing time in since I almost always have a full roster 16/16 but I don't particularly consider any of them to be "core members" either. Hidden information is the topic here, not the amorphous concept of "difficulty". The results of every item interaction except Obstacles and shovels are hidden until a new player either references an external source, or experiments, usually getting punished for doing the latter. Many players either don't realize they can or won't bother referencing external information, and it is unfair to expect them to regardless. Good game design means teaching your players what good in-game behavior 
Explore, Exterminate, Fetch, Carry. That's yer lot as far as normal missions are concerned in DD. Given the number of times you've got to do them, as objectives they get pretty damn boring, particularly as it's likely you avoid doing half of them. Grind is a serious problem in this game, as discussed elsewhere (https://www.reddit.com/r/darkestdungeon/comments/42l2es/ideas_on_how_to_make_the_game_less_grindy/). These wouldn't be solutions, but it sure would make levelling up your heroes For anyone who has had enough trial and error and is willing to kinda give up the whole "do mistakes at your own risk" part of the game, I present to you this CURIO GUIDE ( You can even open it on the steam-interface and favorite it. I just see so many new players asking about CURIO INTERACTIONS and what PROVISIONS to take. Well. Here you go, this gives you all the information you need about CURIOS to make conscious. Sorry this comment and/or post has been removed by user. Unless it was a spreadsheet, this information is likely irretrievable. If it is a spreadsheet, feel free to PM me and I might still So I hear you like shortcuts. I hear you like to not progress Kappa But enough memes lets talk about how we can break the game. So to give a bit of background I'm one of those people from the speedrun community finding all the things that can really let you cheese and break the game. So talking the fundimentals is a trick we call "Scardycat" Or "Scardycatting" This is where you enter the darkest dungeon with one level 0 hero then retreat. This will keep the hero alive When I first started playing the game game, I often picked a specific class to open up a curio, thinking that their expertise would lead to better results or hidden insights. Turns out that doesn't matter at all, it's just a fixed random chance each time. That's a real bummer, because there was some real potential for unique interactions or dialog, e. g. grave robber for excavating the fresh graves in the weald librarian for book shelves and piles occultist for bas-reliefs highwayman. 
I don't know about others, but I was personally disappointed by Color of Madness. I found the endless harvest to be heavily imbalanced on different classes making it a farcry from taking your favorite party in to see how well they do and despite using enemies from all regions, it has a more distinct class tier list than any other region (not helping matters is how one of the top tier classes is from a different DLC). And even when you do have the perfect parties, the gameplay is just grindy BLACK AS DEATH: Beta Black as Death is now available on the Steam Workshop. Please consider exploring this new mod and providing as much feedback as you’d like. Criticism is always welcome. It can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1540058176 (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1540058176) amp#x200B; IMPORTANT : It is best played with all DLC available (CC, SB, CoM, and Musk). amp#x200B; Black as Death is a gameplay overhau. This is meant to be an introductory, but rather extensive, guide for people new to the game, and obviously personal preference takes place over min/maxing, so take this with a grain of salt. There shouldn't be any spoilers in here. The basics of party composition: There are three main factors in deciding which heroes to use: sustain, damage types, and the ability to hit all positions. It is especially important to have heroes which can deal high damage to position 3 and 4, since that's. Piece of SHIT game mods. The ones that work just fine and fucking dandy one gameplay session, but fuck everything up the next time you place. Fucking Darkest Dungeon workshop assholes can't code for shit. Play the game once? All the mods work. They lovingly stroke my computer's dick while I enjoy some eldritch horrors. I quit the game, go do all the bullshit I have to do in life, come back (computer didn't restart or turn off) and start the game up again. "I can't use that object The above build, #24099 is now in COMING IN HOT beta stream in Steam. As soon as we're confident it's stable, we'll be moving it to LIVE. So feel free to try the Coming in Hot beta! (PC/Mac/Linux) Patch Notes Steam Build #24099 Darkest Dungeon The Collector: Man At Arms head now has a damage + stun attack. Vestal head now has a damage + stress attack. Also they should augment the offensive Dismas head better. This should make Collector less exploitable for stalling. Updated monster brains:. Whew, we made it through E3! If you were wondering where this post was last week, we decided to hold off until the E3 craziness was over, the sub was nuts but it was super fun. This week I’ve added Metacritic scores, if available yet. The format is Critic score/user score. Some games don’t have enough critic reviews for a metascore, so I just put the user score down. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to see, or any specific games you want to see featured! ___ ##GAMES.
